The `MediaViewer` component is designed to manage and display media content, specifically images. This component utilizes React functional component architecture, incorporating hooks for state management and effects to handle data fetching, WebSocket communication, and user interactions.

### Key Concepts and Technologies:

- **State Management with Hooks:** Utilizes `useState` to track component state including media information (`mediaInfo`), pagination data (`page`, `totalPages`, `limit`), selection status (`selectedMedia`, `MediaSelected`), and loading state (`loading`). This approach facilitates the dynamic rendering of UI based on the current state.

- **Effect Hook for Side Effects:** `useEffect` is used to perform side effects such as fetching media data upon component mount and in response to dependencies changes (e.g., `page`, `limit`). It also establishes and tears down WebSocket connections for real-time communication.

- **Real-time Communication with WebSocket:** Utilizes `socket.io-client` to establish a WebSocket connection for receiving real-time updates about media content (e.g., image uploads and deletions). This ensures the UI remains synchronized with the server state without manual refreshes.

- **Ref Hook for Component Lifecycle:** `useRef` creates a mutable `isMounted` ref object to track the component's mount status, preventing state updates on an unmounted component, which can lead to memory leaks or errors.

- **Modular Child Components and Utility Functions:** Delegates specific responsibilities to child components (e.g., `ImageBlock`) and utility functions (`fetchData`, `deleteImage`), promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.

- **User Interaction Handling:** Implements functions to handle user actions such as image selection and deletion, encapsulating the logic for updating state and communicating with parent components or performing side effects like API calls.

- **Pagination and Conditional Rendering:** Incorporates logic for navigating through media content via pagination and dynamically rendering UI elements based on the component's state (e.g., loading indicators, media content, pagination controls).

### Component Lifecycle and Flow:

1. **Initialization:** On component mount, initializes state, fetches initial media data, and sets up WebSocket listeners for `image-uploaded` and `image-deleted` events.
2. **Data Fetching and Real-time Updates:** Fetches media data based on current pagination and listens for real-time events to refresh data as needed.
3. **User Interaction:** Responds to user actions such as image selection and deletion, updating state accordingly and performing necessary side effects.
4. **Cleanup:** Prior to unmounting, performs cleanup by removing WebSocket listeners and resetting `isMounted` to prevent updates to an unmounted component.

This component exemplifies a pattern for building interactive, real-time web interfaces with React, combining stateful logic, effectful operations, and WebSocket communications within a functional component structure.

The `MediaViewer` component in your description is a complex React component that interacts with a backend service via WebSocket and a REST API to manage and display media files. Below, I'll explain the flow of information within the component, the purpose of each function, and how it interacts with the parent component or external services.

### Component Structure and Props

- **Props**:
  - `sendSelect`: A function provided by the parent component to handle the selection of an image.
  - `modalWindow`: A boolean indicating if the component is being displayed within a modal window.
  - `setImageSlot`: A function provided by the parent component to set the selected image.

### State Management

- **useState Hooks**:
  - `mediaInfo`: Stores an array of media objects fetched from the backend.
  - `page`, `totalPages`, `limit`: Control pagination of media files.
  - `selectedMedia`: Tracks the currently selected media.
  - `loading`: Indicates whether the component is currently fetching data.
  - `MediaSelected`: A boolean indicating if any media has been selected.

### Effects and Lifecycle

- **useEffect Hook**: Used for fetching media data and setting up WebSocket listeners on component mount and whenever `page` or `limit` changes. It also handles cleanup on component unmount.

### Real-time Updates with WebSockets

- **WebSocket Connection**: Established to listen for real-time events (`image-uploaded` and `image-deleted`) that trigger a refresh of the media data.

### Functions

- **fetchData**: Called within `useEffect` to fetch media data from the backend based on the current `page` and `limit`. It updates `mediaInfo`, `totalPages`, and `loading` state.

- **handleImageSelect**: Handles user actions when selecting an image. It updates the `selectedMedia` state and uses `sendSelect` to communicate the selection back to the parent component.

- **handleDeleteMedia**: Invokes the `deleteImage` utility function to delete a selected image from the backend and updates the UI accordingly.

- **setImage**: Called when the "Select Image" button is clicked. It uses `setImageSlot` to pass the selected image information back to the parent component.

### User Interaction and Rendering

- The component renders a list of `ImageBlock` components for each image in `mediaInfo`, passing down props for image URL, ID, and alt text, along with a `select` function to handle selection.

- It conditionally renders UI elements such as a loading indicator, delete button, and pagination controls based on the current state.

- The component dynamically updates in response to user interactions (selecting/deleting images) and real-time backend events (image uploads/deletions), ensuring the UI is always synchronized with the backend state.

### Interaction with Parent Component

- **Selection and Deletion**: When a user selects or deletes an image, the component communicates these actions back to the parent component via `sendSelect` and `setImageSlot`, enabling the parent component to react accordingly (e.g., updating its own state or UI based on the selection or deletion of images).

### Summary

The `MediaViewer` component is a sophisticated interface for displaying and managing media files, leveraging React's stateful logic, effectful operations, WebSocket for real-time updates, and modular child components for clean and effective user interaction. Its design allows for efficient data fetching, dynamic UI updates based on user actions and real-time events, and seamless integration with parent components through defined props and state management practices.
